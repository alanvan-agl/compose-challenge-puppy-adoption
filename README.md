## :bulb: Motivation and Context
<!--- Optionally point readers to interesting parts of your submission. -->
<!--- What are you especially proud of? -->
I am especially proud of being able to use Jetpack compose with the UDF pattern to quickly create a
puppy adoption app (fetching real data). I feel that it is a totally new paradigm of Android UI development and I 
do enjoy the process.
I'm proud of the clean architecture of the app that I am able to create in a very short period of time.
